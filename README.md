# Nest (Working Title, Likely To Change)

Goal: Free backend hosting provided by Hack Club HQ for every teenager in the world, but especially Hack Clubbers.

Basic problem for us to solve: many teenagers literally can't deploy any backend services right now because they don't have credit cards or income and most hosting free tiers have disappeared (looking at you Heroku ðŸ˜”). We want to change that! As a public good!

_Revamp of Hack As a Service ([v1](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-as-a-service), [v2](https://github.com/hack-as-a-service))_

Working title for Hack Club HQ's revamp of #hack-as-a-service. Hack Club tilde server, anyone?

This needs to serve 3 types of teenagers:

1. I know how to write HTML and CSS and just wrote my first ever backend and need to host it. Completely unfamiliar with SSH, Linux, and traditional deployments through flows like Heroku. Probably has heard of Vercel for frontend hosting. Likely coding on repl.it.

2. I have deployed backend services to places like Railway, but am deeply frustrated with their limits because I am a teenager and I don't have a credit card or income to pay for the paid tiers. I can't even sign up for Heroku because I don't have a credit card. I like giving a Procfile or Dockerfile and need a place to host it with a Postgres database that is reliable and won't go down. I don't need it to be "production grade", this is more for personal projects or semi-professional projects that don't have high volume. I need some kind of secrets management for environment variables.

3. I am a homelab guru, highly technical, "do you know that I run Arch / NixOS?", strongly opinioned on distros, watches DistroTube, etc. I don't use vim, I use neovim. I don't use neovim, I use a custom editor that I wrote for myself in Rust! I usually deploy my own services on my homelab, but it constantly goes down so I want something more reliable for my Slack and Discord bots / etc.

This means that Nest will need to host not just applications and websites, but also other services, especially databases.
